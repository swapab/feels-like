# Feels-Like
Raspberry-Pi: LDR to LCD display current light intensity

## Great! But how it works?
1. LDR(Light Dependent Resistor) reads data on a GPIO pin(BCM pin 4 or BOARD pin 7)
2. Based on the readings the 16x2 LCD displays if it's Sunny, Dark or Night.

## What next?
If asked "How does it feels like?", alexa or amazon-echo-dot should reply with saying the respective reading status.
